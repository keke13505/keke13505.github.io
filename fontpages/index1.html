Say! What a lot
Of fish there are.
Yes. Some are red. And some are blue.
Some are old. And some are new.</div>

Sad and glad and bad?

Go ask your dad.</div>

Some are thin.
And some are fat.
The fat one has
A yellow hat.
From there to here, from here to there,
Funny things
Are everywhere. 
Here are some
Who like to run.
They run for fun
In the hot, hot sun.
Oh me! Oh my!
Oh me! Oh my!
What a lot
Of funny things go by. </div>

Some have two feet
And some have four.
Some have six feet
And some have more.

But I bet they have come a long, long way.

We see them go. </div>

Look at his fingers!
One, two, three…
How many fingers
Do I see?
One, two, three, four,
Five, six, seven,
Eight, nine, ten.
He has eleven!
Eleven!
This is something new.
I wish I had
Eleven, too! </div>  </p>
